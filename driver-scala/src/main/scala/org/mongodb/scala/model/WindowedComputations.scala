/**
 * Builders for [[WindowedComputation windowed computations]] used in the
 * [[Aggregates.setWindowFields \$setWindowFields]] pipeline stage
 * of an aggregation pipeline. Each windowed computation is a triple:
 *  - A window function. Some functions require documents in a window to be sorted
 *  (see `sortBy` in [[Aggregates.setWindowFields]]).
 *  - An optional [[Window window]], a.k.a. frame.
 *  Specifying `null` window is equivalent to specifying an unbounded window,
 *  i.e., a window with both ends specified as [[Windows.Bound UNBOUNDED]].
 *  Some window functions require to specify an explicit unbounded window instead of specifying `null`.
 *  - A path to an output field to be computed by the window function over the window.
 *
 * A windowed computation is similar to an [[Accumulators accumulator]] but does not result in folding documents constituting
 * the window into a single document.
 *
 * @see [[https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#field-paths Field paths]]
